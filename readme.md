##about

A grain of fun!

![](img/logo.png)

Cubic by Chinnee is a little fun project by 2 friends.

Can symmetry exist through space?
Can a connection be made despite the distance?
Can the same message be conveyed from 2 different places?
Cubic will explore these questions.

Each post will have 2 pictures from 2 corners of the world with a little Haiku. 
But they will say the same message.

Can you decipher it?
